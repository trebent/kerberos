## Observability

### Metrics

Kerberos produces the following request/response metrics:

* `request_count_total`
* `request_duration_milliseconds_bucket`
* `request_size_bytes_bucket`
* `response_size_bytes_bucket`
* `response_total`

All bucket types also have a `_sum` and `_total` variant.


#### Labelling

Request/response metrics are labelled with the backend they belong to, along with pertinent HTTP information that won't cause too large dimensions. In most cases this includes the HTTP method. The `response_total` metric additionally has the response code as a label added to it.


### Tracing

Kerberos will start a span once a request is received. This span may or may not have a parent span, depending on if the incoming request has a trace context set in its request headers. Spans are propagated to forwarded routes to allow backends to associate child spans with the parent trace generated by Kerberos or a higher level component.
